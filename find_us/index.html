                    <h2>6 AM: A Quiet Yet Busy Start</h2>
                    <p>While the city is still asleep, our kitchen is already coming to life. Chef Dion, our head<br>
                        chef, begins his day with an inspection of the ingredients — ensuring everything is <br>
                        fresh and ready to be prepared. The prep team starts chopping, weighing, and <br>
                        meticulously crafting the bases for sauces and broths.</p>
                    <div class = "comment">
                        <div class = "line"></div>
                        <p>"We believe that a disciplined morning yields honest flavors," says Chef<br>
                             Dion as he prepares the chicken stock that has been a staple of this<br>
                             restaurant since day one.</p>

                    <h2>10 AM – Briefing, Taste Tests, and Experiments</h2>
                    <p>Once all the ingredients are ready, the team gathers to taste and evaluate the menu<br>
                         for the day. There’s also a session for experimentation — our young chef, Alya, tries to<br> 
                         blend traditional spices with modern plating techniques.</p>
                    <div class = "comment">
                        <div class = "line"></div>
                        <p>"Chef Dion always encourages us to boldly play with flavors — but to <br>
                            respect the ingredients," says Alya while stirring the coconut-salt sauce<br>
                             that will top the latest fusion dish.</p>

                    <h2>12 PM – Time for Service to Begin</h2>
                    <p>As lunchtime arrives, the kitchen transforms into a battlefield. The sounds of stoves,
                         grills, and incoming orders echo in harmony. But everything operates like a <br>
                         symphony. Each chef knows their position. Coordination is swift, accurate, and panic-<br>
                         free.</p>
                    <div class = "comment">

                        <p>Amid the hustle, plating remains an art. Every detail — from the<br>
                             placement of basil leaves to the lines of sauce on the plate — is arranged<br>
                              with love.</p>

                    <h2>Serving More Than Just Food</h2>
                    <p>At the restaurant, each chef brings their passion, experience, and love for cooking <br>
                        into the kitchen. They are flavor artists working without the spotlight, yet making a<br>
                         significant impact on each guest's experience.</p>
                    <p>Now, as you enjoy our dishes, you know — there are stories, dedication, and an<br>
                         incredible team behind every serving.</p>
